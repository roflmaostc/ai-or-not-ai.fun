# [aiornot.fun](https://aiornot.fun) - the most lit quiz on the web! 🚀🔥
Ever wondered if that dense, jargon-filled 🤯📝 paper you stumbled upon is about AI 🤖 or just some other random scientific 🧪🔬👨‍🔬 rabbit hole? Well, wonder no more! We've created a quirky quiz that separates the AI from the "AIn't"! 🎉🔍🚫

Our secret sauce? We've gone full "hacky af" 💻🧙‍♂️ and leaned heavily on [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com)🤖🗨️ to whip up the source code for this masterpiece.
As for the papers, we collected them by hand ✋ (no, not a robot hand 🤖🤚).

Whether you want to suggest a zany 🤪🤪 paper title with a short explanation or roll up your sleeves and dive into the HTML code, we've got room for all your fun-loving contributions.
